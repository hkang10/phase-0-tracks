# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows you save different version of your project so that in case there may be an error, you are able to go back to a previous working version.  This is useful especially when you are working on an on-going project that requires a lot of add-ons and/or changes, you are able to revert to the last working version so it saves you time and refrains you from starting over.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branch by defnition is a line of development.  It basically clones what you have and you're adding to the line. There's an original which is called "master" which is like the trunk of  a tree and all the other branches will originate back to the master(or tree trunk).  You would use one lets say you were working on a project and more assignments were asked to be added on after the draft was already sent in.  While you're adding your revisions, they asked to share with them the original so you would send them the master branch that doesn't include any revisions that has been included in there already.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commits are essentially the same as save points where you are working on a project and it saves at the point of where you're at on the project.  If for some reason, you come across a non-working version, you can always commit yourself back to the version that was working.  A good commit message is short and sweet.  It should be specific not vague so that it allows you to know at what point of the project you were at.

* What is a merge conflict?
 A merge conflict happens when a commit to be merged in has a change in one place, and the current commit has a change in the same place.
