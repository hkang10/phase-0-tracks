#Release 0 - Design a class
#3 attributes
#3 methods (one with argument)

#Release 1 -Write Your Clas
#Implement your class
#include - att_reader, attr_accessor, and initialize

#Release 2 - Use Your Class in a Program
#User interface via command line
#User should be allowed to create as many instances of your class
#Prompt user for each attribute and store these class instances into an array
#when user indicates finished creating instances, loop through an array and print out the attributes of each instances
