# Reflection Section
#require_relative - shortcut to the file within the same directory.
#require - bigger scope where you can retrieve file outside of directory.
#What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
#What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
#What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
#When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
#What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
